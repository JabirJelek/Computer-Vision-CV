Below is prompt to make a thread focus conversation

**CONTEXT PRESERVATION REQUEST**

I'm continuing a previous conversation about computer vision architecture. Please maintain context from this discussion:

**Previous Topic**: Selective frame processing architecture with two threads:
1. **Capture Thread**: Continuous frame capture with single-frame buffer
2. **Processing Thread**: Fixed-interval frame sampling for reduced CPU usage

**Key Technical Details**:
- Single-frame buffer (automatically drops unnecessary frames)
- Processing at fixed time intervals instead of frame counting
- Thread synchronization with locks
- Massive CPU reduction (93%+ when processing 2fps vs 30fps capture)
- Modular `SelectiveFrameProcessor` class implementation

**Current Implementation Status**:
We've implemented a working selective frame processor with:
- Continuous capture thread keeping only latest frame
- Processing thread sampling at configurable intervals
- Real-time display with frame information overlay
- Dynamic interval adjustment capability

**When I return, I may want to**:
- Optimize the implementation further
- Add specific computer vision processing
- Extend the architecture with additional features
- Discuss performance tuning or alternative approaches

Please maintain this technical context and be ready to continue development discussions.

**TECHNICAL CONTEXT PRESERVATION**

Continuing computer vision discussion: Selective frame processing architecture with capture thread (continuous) + processing thread (fixed intervals). Single-frame buffer automatically drops unnecessary frames. Current implementation uses `SelectiveFrameProcessor` class with configurable sampling intervals.

Maintain context about thread synchronization, CPU reduction benefits, and modular design for when I return with questions or extensions.
