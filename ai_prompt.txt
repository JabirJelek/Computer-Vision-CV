Below is prompt to make a thread focus conversation. This prompt after saving file: ...threaded_1.py

**CONTEXT PRESERVATION REQUEST**

I'm continuing a previous conversation about computer vision architecture. Please maintain context from this discussion:

**Previous Topic**: Selective frame processing architecture with two threads:
1. **Capture Thread**: Continuous frame capture with single-frame buffer
2. **Processing Thread**: Fixed-interval frame sampling for reduced CPU usage

**Key Technical Details**:
- Single-frame buffer (automatically drops unnecessary frames)
- Processing at fixed time intervals instead of frame counting
- Thread synchronization with locks
- Massive CPU reduction (93%+ when processing 2fps vs 30fps capture)
- Modular `SelectiveFrameProcessor` class implementation

**Current Implementation Status**:
We've implemented a working selective frame processor with:
- Continuous capture thread keeping only latest frame
- Processing thread sampling at configurable intervals
- Real-time display with frame information overlay
- Dynamic interval adjustment capability

**When I return, I may want to**:
- Optimize the implementation further
- Add specific computer vision processing
- Extend the architecture with additional features
- Discuss performance tuning or alternative approaches

Please maintain this technical context and be ready to continue development discussions.

**TECHNICAL CONTEXT PRESERVATION**

Continuing computer vision discussion: Selective frame processing architecture with capture thread (continuous) + processing thread (fixed intervals). Single-frame buffer automatically drops unnecessary frames. Current implementation uses `SelectiveFrameProcessor` class with configurable sampling intervals.

Maintain context about thread synchronization, CPU reduction benefits, and modular design for when I return with questions or extensions.

EXCEPTION NOTE
User has explicitly stated they are not utilizing video file processing capabilities, though the functionality remains implemented in the codebase. Future discussions should prioritize camera and RTSP use cases unless otherwise specified.

REMEMBER: This is a PRODUCTION-READY YOLO integration framework specifically optimized for the user's camera-based object detection applications with modular alert capabilities, custom bounding box labeling, class suppression, and a designed audio alert system ready for implementation. The selective sampling architecture prevents model overload while maintaining real-time responsiveness, the logging system provides comprehensive detection documentation, and the system only displays bounding boxes for classes specified in alert_classes.txt.
