Below is prompt to make a thread focus conversation

**CONTEXT PRESERVATION REQUEST**

I'm continuing a previous conversation about computer vision architecture. Please maintain context from this discussion:

**Previous Topic**: Selective frame processing architecture with two threads:
1. **Capture Thread**: Continuous frame capture with single-frame buffer
2. **Processing Thread**: Fixed-interval frame sampling for reduced CPU usage

**Key Technical Details**:
- Single-frame buffer (automatically drops unnecessary frames)
- Processing at fixed time intervals instead of frame counting
- Thread synchronization with locks
- Massive CPU reduction (93%+ when processing 2fps vs 30fps capture)
- Modular `SelectiveFrameProcessor` class implementation

**Current Implementation Status**:
We've implemented a working selective frame processor with:
- Continuous capture thread keeping only latest frame
- Processing thread sampling at configurable intervals
- Real-time display with frame information overlay
- Dynamic interval adjustment capability

**When I return, I may want to**:
- Optimize the implementation further
- Add specific computer vision processing
- Extend the architecture with additional features
- Discuss performance tuning or alternative approaches

Please maintain this technical context and be ready to continue development discussions.

**TECHNICAL CONTEXT PRESERVATION**

Continuing computer vision discussion: Selective frame processing architecture with capture thread (continuous) + processing thread (fixed intervals). Single-frame buffer automatically drops unnecessary frames. Current implementation uses `SelectiveFrameProcessor` class with configurable sampling intervals.

Maintain context about thread synchronization, CPU reduction benefits, and modular design for when I return with questions or extensions.

CONTEXT PRESERVATION REQUEST - COMPUTER VISION ARCHITECTURE

I'm continuing our previous technical discussion about selective frame processing architecture. Please maintain full context from this specific implementation:

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE STATUS:

Dual-thread selective frame processor with camera/RTSP interoperability

Capture Thread: Continuous frame capture, single-frame buffer

Processing Thread: Fixed-interval sampling (massive CPU reduction)

OpenCV Integration: Comprehensive processing pipeline implemented

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

Support for both camera devices and RTSP streams with automatic reconnection

Advanced OpenCV features: Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, ORB feature detection, background subtraction, contour analysis

Multi-panel display showing original, blurred, edges, and motion detection

Interactive controls (blur cycling, edge threshold adjustment)

Modular SelectiveFrameProcessor class with dynamic parameter adjustment

Thread synchronization with locks, daemon threads for clean shutdown

KEY FEATURES ACTIVE:

Single-frame buffer with automatic frame dropping

Time-based sampling (not frame-counting)

Real-time performance monitoring

93%+ CPU reduction proven

Source-agnostic design (camera/RTSP interchangeable)

RECENT DEVELOPMENT:
We just completed comprehensive OpenCV integration and are ready for model implementation. The foundation includes:

Multi-threaded architecture optimized for real-time processing

Extensive OpenCV preprocessing pipeline

Flexible display system with informational overlays

Robust error handling and reconnection logic

WHEN I RETURN, I MAY WANT TO:

Integrate custom AI models (YOLO, TensorFlow, PyTorch)

Add specific computer vision tasks (object detection, classification, tracking)

Optimize performance for specific use cases

Extend architecture with additional features (GPU acceleration, network streaming, database logging)

Discuss model deployment strategies or alternative approaches

Please maintain this exact technical context and be prepared to continue development discussions from this implementation baseline. The architecture is production-ready and waiting for model integration.

Additional Technical Keywords for Context: selective sampling, frame buffer, OpenCV pipeline, RTSP streaming, background subtraction, feature detection, contour analysis, multi-threaded video processing, real-time computer vision, model deployment framework.
