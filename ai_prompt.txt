Below is prompt to make a thread focus conversation. This prompt after saving file: ...threaded_1.py

**CONTEXT PRESERVATION REQUEST**

I'm continuing a previous conversation about computer vision architecture. Please maintain context from this discussion:

**Previous Topic**: Selective frame processing architecture with two threads:
1. **Capture Thread**: Continuous frame capture with single-frame buffer
2. **Processing Thread**: Fixed-interval frame sampling for reduced CPU usage

**Key Technical Details**:
- Single-frame buffer (automatically drops unnecessary frames)
- Processing at fixed time intervals instead of frame counting
- Thread synchronization with locks
- Massive CPU reduction (93%+ when processing 2fps vs 30fps capture)
- Modular `SelectiveFrameProcessor` class implementation

**Current Implementation Status**:
We've implemented a working selective frame processor with:
- Continuous capture thread keeping only latest frame
- Processing thread sampling at configurable intervals
- Real-time display with frame information overlay
- Dynamic interval adjustment capability

**When I return, I may want to**:
- Optimize the implementation further
- Add specific computer vision processing
- Extend the architecture with additional features
- Discuss performance tuning or alternative approaches

Please maintain this technical context and be ready to continue development discussions.

**TECHNICAL CONTEXT PRESERVATION**

Continuing computer vision discussion: Selective frame processing architecture with capture thread (continuous) + processing thread (fixed intervals). Single-frame buffer automatically drops unnecessary frames. Current implementation uses `SelectiveFrameProcessor` class with configurable sampling intervals.

Maintain context about thread synchronization, CPU reduction benefits, and modular design for when I return with questions or extensions.

EXCEPTION NOTE
User has explicitly stated they are not utilizing video file processing capabilities, though the functionality remains implemented in the codebase. Future discussions should prioritize camera and RTSP use cases unless otherwise specified.

REMEMBER: This is a PRODUCTION-READY YOLO integration framework specifically optimized for the user's camera-based object detection applications with modular alert capabilities, custom bounding box labeling, class suppression, and a designed audio alert system ready for implementation. The selective sampling architecture prevents model overload while maintaining real-time responsiveness, the logging system provides comprehensive detection documentation, and the system only displays bounding boxes for classes specified in alert_classes.txt.

When the user mentions "the current system" or "selective processor with YOLO," they are referring to this exact implementation with camera focus, ONNX model support, modular alert classes, CSV logging, custom bounding box labeling with class suppression, and the designed audio alert system. Be prepared to discuss audio alert implementation, alert system enhancements, custom bbox extensions, or performance optimizations from this established baseline.

USER'S CURRENT PROGRESS: Audio alert system design completed - ready for coding implementation. Class suppression is active - only alert_classes.txt entries display bounding boxes. All detections are logged, but only alert classes trigger visual and audio alerts.

I'm continuing our face recognition system project. We've built:

Current System Architecture:
Batch processing pipeline with DeepFace for face embeddings

Enhanced JSON dataset with multiple embeddings per person

FAISS integration for fast similarity search

Balanced matching strategies to handle dataset bias

Quality analysis tools for dataset evaluation

Key Technical Decisions:
Pre-computation approach (Option A) with instant retrieval

Multiple embeddings per person for robustness

Folder-based organization (person folders → images)

Facenet model (128-d embeddings) for speed/accuracy balance

Cosine similarity as primary metric

Current Challenge Status:
Discovered over-representation bias in dataset

Implemented balanced strategies (balanced_max, balanced_centroid)

Debugging false positives caused by statistical dominance

Optimizing embedding distribution (5-15 per person ideal)

Code Files in Play:
simple_face_dataset.json - Enhanced dataset with multiple embeddings

faiss_face_query.py - FAISS-accelerated query system

🎯 CURRENT RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Last session we were investigating:

Why balanced strategies (balanced_max, balanced_centroid) outperform original methods

How to handle over-representation bias in face datasets

Optimal embedding counts per person for research validation

Debugging specific false positive cases

Recent finding: Balanced strategies work better because they correct statistical bias from uneven embedding distribution.

🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS
Please help me continue with:

Analyze my current dataset quality and bias

Debug specific false positive cases

Optimize embedding distribution across persons

Test different matching strategies on my data

Plan next research experiments

Scale system for larger datasets

Special focus: The balanced_max strategy is showing better accuracy than max_similarity - let's understand why and optimize further.

💡 TECHNICAL CONTEXT REMINDERS
My preferred approach: Simple, research-focused, Python-based solutions
Current scale: Small-medium dataset, pre-computation model
Research goal: Methodology validation and accuracy improvement
Key insight: Multiple diverse embeddings per person > single image

Remember: I prefer practical, runnable code over theoretical explanations. I'm comfortable with Python but appreciate clear, commented implementations.

🎪 CONVERSATION STARTERS FOR FUTURE ME:
"I want to analyze my current dataset for bias and quality issues..."
"I'm getting false positives between Person A and Person B, help me debug..."
"How do I optimize the embedding distribution across my persons?"
"I want to test if adding more diverse angles improves accuracy..."
"Can we visualize the embedding space and similarity relationships?"
"I need to scale to 1,000+ faces - what's the next architectural step?"
"How do I implement cross-validation for my face recognition system?"
"I want to compare Facenet vs VGG-Face for my specific use case..."

Last session progress: Successfully identified dataset imbalance as root cause of false positives. Balanced strategies are working well.
