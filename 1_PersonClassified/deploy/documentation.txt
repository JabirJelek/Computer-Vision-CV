1. PURPOSE:
RTSP stream object detection system using YOLO model with real-time counting, cumulative statistics, and automatic reconnection.

2. STRUCTURE:
Imports: cv2, ultralytics.YOLO, pathlib, collections.Counter, time
Classes: RTSPDetector (complete RTSP detection pipeline)
Functions: main() - configuration and execution
Constants: MODEL_PATH, RTSP_URL, CONF_THRESHOLD configuration

3. USAGE:
Run script to connect to RTSP stream, perform real-time object detection with YOLO, and display cumulative counts with automatic reconnection.

4. NOTES:
Strengths: Robust reconnection logic, real-time and cumulative counting, optimized RTSP settings, comprehensive error handling
Limitations: Hard-coded model path, incomplete RTSP URL requiring parameters, specific to ONNX model format
